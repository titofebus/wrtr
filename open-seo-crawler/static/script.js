Replace or remove the section.', sources: [['Google - Creating helpful content', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content']] },
  'Canonical contains a fragment': { sev: 'warn', why: 'Google drops everything after the # when reading a canonical, so the tag resolves to a different URL than intended. Write the canonical without the fragment.', sources: [['Google - Canonicalization', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls']] },
  'Canonical points to a non-200 URL': { sev: 'error', why: 'The canonical names a URL that returns an error, so this page asks to be dropped in favour of a page that cannot be indexed.

  'No <head> element': { sev: 'error', why: 'The document has no head, so every tag that belongs there lands in the body where Google ignores it. Title, canonical and robots directives all stop working at once.', sources: [['MDN - The document metadata element', 'https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head']] },
  'No <body> element': { sev: 'warn', why: 'The document has no body element.

  'HTML document over 2MB': { sev: 'warn', why: 'Google stops reading an HTML document at around 2MB, so anything past that point is invisible however good it is. Oversized documents are usually an inlined asset or an unpaginated listing.', sources: [['Google - Indexing limits', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot']] },
  'No internal outlinks': { sev: 'warn', why: 'The page links nowhere on the site, so crawling and link equity both stop here. On a page that earns traffic or links this wastes everything it has. Usually a template with a JavaScript-only navigation, or a landing page built outside the main theme.', sources: [['Google - Internal links', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/links-crawlable']] },
  'Inbound internal links come only from non-indexable pages': { sev: 'warn', why: 'Every internal link to this page comes from a page set to noindex, such as a tag archive or a date archive.

Add at least one link from a page that is indexed.', sources: [['Google - Internal links', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/links-crawlable']] },
  'Title outside head': { sev: 'error', why: 'A browser closes <head> at the first tag that does not belong there, such as an <img> or a <div>, and moves everything after it into <body>. The markup still reads as though the tag sat in the head, so this is invisible in the source, but Google takes the title, canonical or robots tag as body content and ignores it. Move the offending element below the closing head tag.', sources: [['Google - Title links', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/title-link']] },
  'Canonical outside head': { sev: 'error', why: 'Google only reads rel=canonical inside <head>. An element that does not belong in the head closes it early, dropping this tag into the body where it counts for nothing, so the page canonicalises to itself by default. Move the element that closes the head, not the canonical.', sources: [['Google - Canonicalization', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls']] },
  'Meta robots outside head': { sev: 'error', why: 'A robots meta tag outside <head> is ignored, so a page meant to be hidden stays indexable, or a directive you rely on silently stops applying. Move whatever closes the head early.', sources: [['Google - Robots meta tag', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag']] },
  'Meta description outside head': { sev: 'warn', why: 'A meta description outside <head> is ignored, so Google writes its own snippet from body copy instead.', sources: [['Google - Snippets', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet']] },
  'Hreflang outside head': { sev: 'warn', why: 'hreflang link elements only count inside <head>. Outside it the whole cluster goes unread and the wrong country version can start ranking.', sources: [['Google - Localized versions', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions']] },
  'Multiple title tags': { sev: 'warn', why: 'Google uses the first title in the document and ignores the rest, which is rarely the one a plugin appended later. Two titles usually means the theme and an SEO plugin are both writing one.', sources: [['Google - Title links', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/title-link']] },
  'Multiple conflicting canonicals': { sev: 'error', why: 'The page names two different canonical URLs. Google treats the conflict as unreliable and falls back to picking its own, so neither of your choices applies. Remove all but one.', sources: [['Google - Canonicalization', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls']] },
  'Multiple canonical tags': { sev: 'warn', why: 'The same canonical is declared more than once. Harmless for ranking, but it means two systems are writing the tag and the next edit may set them to different values.', sources: [['Google - Canonicalization', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls']] },
  'Multiple meta descriptions': { sev: 'warn', why: 'Google picks one of them, usually the first, so the description you wrote may not be the one that shows. Normally the theme and an SEO plugin each writing one.', sources: [['Google - Snippets', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet']] },
  'Multiple viewport tags': { sev: 'warn', why: 'Two viewport declarations give unpredictable mobile rendering, because which one wins depends on the browser. Keep one.', sources: [['web.dev - Viewport', 'https://web.dev/articles/responsive-web-design-basics']] },
  'Canonical conflict: HTML and HTTP header disagree': { sev: 'error', why: 'The page declares one canonical in the HTML and a different one in the HTTP Link header. Google picks one and it may not be yours. Serve a single canonical from one place.', sources: [['Google - Canonicalization', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls']] },
  'Canonical only in the HTTP header': { sev: 'warn', why: 'The canonical is delivered by a header, so nobody editing the page or reading its source will see it. Valid, but the next template change will not account for it.', sources: [['Google - Canonicalization', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls']] },
  'Canonical points to HTTP from an HTTPS page': { sev: 'warn', why: 'An HTTPS page naming an HTTP canonical asks Google to index the insecure URL, which then redirects. Point it at the https version.', sources: [['Google - Canonicalization', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls']] },
  'Canonical is a relative URL': { sev: 'warn', why: 'Google resolves a relative canonical against the page, so it usually works, but any change to the base URL or a proxy path silently repoints it. Use the absolute URL.', sources: [['Google - Canonicalization', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls']] },
  'Canonical points to another host': { sev: 'warn', why: 'The canonical hands ranking to a different host. Deliberate for syndicated content and after a migration, a mistake when a staging or CDN hostname was left in the template.', sources: [['Google - Canonicalization', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls']] },
  'Canonical is malformed': { sev: 'error', why: 'The canonical URL carries an unresolved template variable, so it points at a URL that does not exist, for example a host with "undefined" stuck on the end. Google is being told the real page lives somewhere unreachable, which can drop this one from the index. Fix the template that builds the tag.', sources: [['Google - Canonicalization', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls']] },
  'Noindex plus a canonical to another URL': { sev: 'warn', why: 'These two signals contradict each other: the canonical says consolidate onto another URL, while noindex says drop this one. Google may apply the noindex to the canonical target as well. Use one or the other.', sources: [['Google - Canonicalization', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls']] },
  'Canonical URL is missing from the hreflang set': { sev: 'warn', why: 'The page\'s own canonical URL does not appear anywhere in its hreflang set, so the cluster and the canonical disagree about which URL represents this page. Google usually discards the hreflang in that case.', sources: [['Google - Localized versions', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions']] },
  'noindex in the X-Robots-Tag header': { sev: 'error', why: 'The page is excluded from the index by an HTTP header, not by anything in the HTML, which is why this one gets missed: the source looks fine. Check the server, CDN or security plugin that adds it.', sources: [['Google - Robots meta tag', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag']] },
  'Conflicting robots directives': { sev: 'error', why: 'The page asks to be indexed and not indexed at once. Google resolves a conflict in favour of the more restrictive rule, so noindex wins and the page disappears. Decide which one was meant.', sources: [['Google - Robots meta tag', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag']] },
  'Robots "none"': { sev: 'error', why: 'none is shorthand for noindex plus nofollow, so the page is excluded from search and its links pass nothing. Almost always copied in by mistake.', sources: [['Google - Robots meta tag', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag']] },
  'nosnippet': { sev: 'warn', why: 'Google shows the result with no description text at all, which cuts click-through hard. Only worth keeping on pages you do not want quoted.', sources: [['Google - Snippets', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet']] },
  'noarchive': { sev: 'info', why: 'Stops Google offering a cached copy. No ranking effect, and Google retired the cache link in 2024, so this rarely matters now.', sources: [['Google - Robots meta tag', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag']] },
  'unavailable_after date has passed': { sev: 'error', why: 'The page carries a date that has already gone by, so Google drops it from results. Usually left over from a campaign or an event page. Remove the directive if the page should stay.', sources: [['Google - Robots meta tag', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag']] },
  'soft 404': { sev: 'error', why: 'The URL answers 200 OK while the page itself says the content is gone, which is what an empty category or a mistyped path usually produces. Google treats these as soft 404s and drops them, and every mistyped URL becomes another indexable duplicate. Return a real 404 or 410, or redirect to the page that replaced it.', sources: [['Google - HTTP status codes', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/http-network-errors']] },
  'Title may truncate in results': { sev: 'warn', why: 'Google cuts desktop titles near 580 pixels, not at a character count, so a title of wide characters clips while a short count looks fine. The figure is an estimate from an Arial width table: treat it as a nudge to put the distinguishing words first, not as an error.', sources: [['Google - Title links', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/title-link']] },
  'Meta description may truncate in results': { sev: 'warn', why: 'Descriptions are cut near 920 pixels on desktop and shorter on mobile. The tail is what disappears, so lead with the outcome and keep the qualifier that earns the click early.', sources: [['Google - Snippets', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet']] },
  'No self-referencing hreflang entry': { sev: 'warn', why: 'Every page in an hreflang set has to list itself. Without it the set is incomplete and Google may discard the whole cluster, which is when the wrong country version starts ranking.', sources: [['Google - Localized versions', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions']] },
  'Invalid hreflang code': { sev: 'warn', why: 'hreflang takes an ISO 639-1 language, optionally with an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 region ("en", "en-AU"). Anything else is ignored silently, so the targeting never applies. "en-UK" is the classic one: the country code for the United Kingdom is GB.', sources: [['Google - Localized versions', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions']] },
  'Duplicate hreflang code with different URLs': { sev: 'warn', why: 'The same language code points at two different URLs, so Google cannot tell which one serves that language and may ignore the pair.', sources: [['Google - Localized versions', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions']] },
  'lang vs hreflang': { sev: 'warn', why: 'The lang attribute on <html> and the page\'s own hreflang entry name different languages. One of the two is wrong, and the mismatch undermines both.', sources: [['Google - Localized versions', 'https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions']] },
  'No lang attribute on <html>': { sev: 'warn', why: 'Without a lang attribute, screen readers guess the pronunciation and browsers offer the wrong translation. Google reads the page language from the content, so this is an accessibility and translation problem more than a ranking one.', sources: [['MDN - The lang attribute', 'https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/lang']] },
  'Invalid lang attribute': { sev: 'warn', why: 'The value is not a language tag, so it is ignored: "english" instead of "en" is the usual one. Use the two-letter code, with a region only when the content really differs by country.', sources: [['MDN - The lang attribute', 'https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/lang']] },
  'H1 too long': { sev: 'warn', why: 'Past about 70 characters an H1 stops working as a heading and reads as a sentence, which makes the page harder to scan. Usually the first line of body copy marked up as a heading by mistake.', sources: [['Moz - Header tags', 'https://moz.com/learn/seo/on-page-factors']] },
  'first heading': { sev: 'info', why: 'The first heading a reader and a crawler meet sets the topic. Starting at H2 is not a ranking penalty, but it usually means the H1 is styled out of the way or wrapped around a logo.', sources: [['Moz - Header tags', 'https://moz.com/learn/seo/on-page-factors']] },
  'Heading level skips': { sev: 'info', why: 'Jumping from H1 to H3 breaks the outline a screen reader announces, and makes the section structure harder for Google to follow. Usually a heading chosen for its font size.', sources: [['MDN - Heading elements', 'https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements']] },
  'internal http links': { sev: 'warn', why: 'An HTTPS page linking to http:// versions of its own site forces an extra redirect on every click and wastes crawl budget.
