## What's new (recent additions)

- **Malformed link href detection** - a scheme-less `href` containing a raw space (a street address or Google Maps Plus Code pasted straight into a link, e.g. `<a href="7FG4+8Q Springfield">Directions</a>`) used to resolve relative to every page carrying it and flood the crawl with phantom 404s - one broken footer link on a 300-page site meant ~300 fake 404 rows. Now it's skipped as a link and reported once per page as a **Malformed link href** issue naming the offending text.
- **JS vs no-JS compare mode** - with Render JS on, tick *Compare with non-JS HTML* to crawl every page in BOTH modes (Playwright-rendered and raw HTML). The per-page diff shows exactly which content is invisible to AI crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended), which mostly don't execute JavaScript.
- **Shared-instance support** - point the saved-crawls list at extra folders (`SITE_CRAWLER_EXTRA_CRAWL_DIRS`) so one office instance shows crawls from multiple tools, and label who ran each crawl by IP (`SITE_CRAWLER_USER_MAP`).
- **Crawl Budget page** - scans the homepage + section pages, buckets every discovered URL by query parameter, classifies crawl-budget traps (Elementor `?e-page-` AJAX pagination, faceted filters, sort / tracking / session params) and generates ready-to-paste robots.txt `Disallow` rules. Shows the sitemap's real page count next to the phantom parameter URLs so the wasted crawl budget is obvious.
- **Soft-404 / infinite-URL-trap detection** - after every crawl, two probe requests check whether the server returns 200 for URLs that cannot exist (`/<token>/` at the root, and nested under a real page). A 200 means the server soft-404s and mints an infinite crawlable URL space; flagged red in the issues sidebar with fix guidance.
- **Images Missing Alt report** - image-centric bulk report: one row per image missing alt text, with every page that embeds it.
- **robots.txt AI-crawler block detection** - flags, as a red error, when robots.txt blocks AI crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, CCBot, Bytespider + 20 more) - meaning the site can't be read or cited by ChatGPT, AI, Perplexity or Google AI Overviews - or when classic search engines (Googlebot/Bingbot) are blocked. Also detects Cloudflare `Content-Signal: ai-train=no` opt-outs. Surfaces on the homepage row in the issues sidebar under **AI Crawlers Blocked** / **Search Engines Blocked**.
- **Post-crawl Summary dashboard** - auto-opens after a crawl finishes with a one-glance view of issues by severity, total pages, response code mix, and the worst offenders.
- **Bulk SEO reports** - All Titles, All Metas, All H1s, All Canonicals, plus dedicated Duplicate Title / Duplicate Meta / Duplicate H1 / Duplicate Body / Multiple H1s / Redirect Chains / Response Codes / Deep Pages / Hreflang reports.
- **Severity-grouped issues view** - pages are bucketed by the worst issue on them (Errors / Warnings / Info) and grouped by issue type so you fix the highest-impact problems first.
- **One-click auto-update** - version badge in the topbar checks GitHub for newer commits and offers a one-click `git pull + restart + page reload` so you're always on the latest code.
- **Dark mode toggle** - explicit per-user choice (persists in localStorage), overrides system `prefers-color-scheme` cleanly.
- **Saved crawls list** - every crawl is auto-saved; reopen any historical crawl from the Load Saved modal. Names of who ran each crawl resolve across multiple tools on the same LAN.
- **Smart noindex / canonicalised handling** - these pages no longer inflate the Error count or get flagged as duplicates by Bulk Reports.

## Features

### Crawling

- **Concurrent crawling** - 5 workers by default, 1-20 configurable. Per-host politeness keeps you under target rate limits while still moving fast.
- **CMS detection + one-click recommendations** - auto-detects Shopify, WordPress (+ Yoast / Rank Math), Webflow, Wix, Squarespace, Kajabi, Ghost, Drupal, HubSpot, Joomla. Applies sensible exclude patterns and JS-render settings per platform.
- **Smart retry** - exponential backoff on 429 / 5xx / connection errors. Respects `Retry-After`. Per-host adaptive back-off doubles when a server starts rate-limiting, decays back when it recovers.
- **Sitemap analysis** - fetches sitemap.xml, cross-checks against the crawl: flags missing from sitemap, orphans, sitemap-only URLs, non-200 in sitemap, redirects in sitemap.
- **Near-duplicate content** - shingle-based Jaccard similarity flags pairs of pages that are 90%+ similar (tweakable 80 / 85 / 90 or custom).
- **Robots.txt aware** (or ignore it, your choice).
- **Glob include / exclude patterns** - `*?variant=*`, `*/cart/*`, etc.
- **Optional JS rendering via Playwright** - install separately for SPA sites (React, Vue, Wix). With **Compare with non-JS HTML** ticked, every page is crawled in both modes and the diff flags content invisible to non-JS crawlers.
- **Built-in crawler-trap protection** - bad links and infinite URL spaces are filtered before they poison your reports, no config needed:
  - Non-page paths skipped (`/feed/`, `/wp-json/`, `/wp-admin/`, `/cdn-cgi/`, sitemap XML, cart/checkout AJAX endpoints)
  - Repeating-segment guard - refuses `/our-team/our-team/`-style URLs minted by path-relative nav hrefs
  - Page-builder pagination/filter params (`?e-page-*`, `?e-filter-*` Elementor AJAX, `?infinity` Jetpack) never enqueued - the classic "26k queued on a 9k-page site" blow-up
  - Bare emails written without `mailto:` (`<a href="sales@example.com">`) dropped instead of becoming fake `/contact/sales@example.com` URLs
  - Plain text pasted into `href` (addresses, Google Maps Plus Codes) reported as a **Malformed link href** issue instead of spawning a phantom 404 under every page
  - Post-crawl soft-404 probes detect servers that return 200 for URLs that cannot exist

### What gets checked per page

- **Titles** - missing, too long (>60 chars), too short, duplicate across pages, identical to H1
- **Meta descriptions** - missing, too long (>160 chars), too short, duplicate across pages
- **H1 tags** - missing, multiple H1s, identical to title, duplicate across pages
- **Canonical tags** - missing, points elsewhere (canonicalised), self-referencing
- **Schema.org structured data** - presence + types detected from both JSON-LD and microdata (`itemtype`) markup
- **Open Graph + Twitter Card** - missing `og:title`, `og:image`, `twitter:card`
- **Content** - thin content (<200 words), near-duplicate bodies (Jaccard similarity)
- **Performance** - slow response time (>3 s)
- **Redirects** - real redirects vs trailing-slash / www / HTTPS normalisations (classified separately so trailing-slash 301s don't pollute your Redirect Chain report)
- **Redirect chains** - multi-hop redirects flagged with full hop list
- **HTTP errors** - 4xx / 5xx with retry counts
- **Indexability** - `noindex` in meta robots or X-Robots-Tag
- **Hreflang** - extracted, validated, missing return-tags flagged
- **Pagination** - `/page/N/`, `?page=N`, `?paged=N` and builder-prefixed variants like `?_page=N` crawled but skipped for SEO issue checks (no false positives for missing meta on paginated archives)
- **Mobile-friendliness** - viewport meta tag presence
- **Mixed content** - HTTPS pages loading HTTP resources
- **URL hygiene** - uppercase, underscores, spaces, >115 chars, tracking parameters
- **Malformed link hrefs** - plain text pasted into an `href` (addresses, Plus Codes) flagged per page instead of crawled as phantom URLs
- **Images** - count of images missing `alt` attributes (decorative `alt=""` not penalised)
- **Security headers** - HTTPS, HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **Deep pages** - URLs more than N clicks from the homepage (configurable)
- **Soft 404s / URL traps** - post-crawl probes detect servers that return 200 for non-existent URLs (root and nested), creating an infinite crawlable URL space; redirects and 4xx/5xx probe responses are treated as healthy

### Bulk reports (sidebar)

Every report exports to XLSX so you can hand it to a content team or dev:

- **All Titles** / **All Metas** / **All H1s** / **All Canonicals** - one row per page
- **Duplicate Titles** / **Duplicate Metas** / **Duplicate H1s** / **Duplicate Bodies** - grouped by duplicate value, normalised URLs (no trailing-slash false positives)
- **Multiple H1s** - pages with 2+ H1 tags, dynamic H1(1) / H1(2) / H1(N) columns
- **Redirect Chains** - pages reached via 2+ hops, with the full chain
- **Response Codes** - breakdown by status code
- **Deep Pages** - URLs N+ clicks from homepage
- **Images Missing Alt** - one row per image missing alt text, with every page that embeds it
- **Hreflang** - extracted, validated, cross-page consistency checked
- **Severity views** - All Errors / All Warnings / All Info, with irrelevant columns hidden per view

### Crawl budget analysis

- **On-demand Crawl Budget page** (topbar) - no full crawl needed: scans the homepage and section pages, buckets every discovered URL by query parameter, and classifies which parameters are crawl-budget traps - Elementor `?e-page-` AJAX pagination, faceted filters, sort orders, tracking and session IDs.
- **Ready-to-paste robots.txt rules** - generates the exact `Disallow` lines to block each trap, and explains what each trap is and why robots.txt is the right fix.
- **Waste made visible** - shows the sitemap's real page count next to the phantom parameter URLs, so you can see how much crawl budget is spent on URLs that shouldn't exist.
- **Soft-404 / infinite-URL-trap probe** - runs automatically after every crawl; results land in a red **URL Traps** category in the issues sidebar with a detail panel and fix guidance.

### Auto-update + version badge

- Topbar version badge shows the current build, polls GitHub for newer commits, and flips to **"Update available"** when there's a newer master commit.
- One click runs `git pull + restart service + reload page` end-to-end. No SSH, no manual commands.
- Background daily auto-update (Linux systemd timer / macOS LaunchAgent / Windows Task Scheduler) keeps everyone on the latest without you thinking about it. Rolls back automatically if a pull breaks the app.

### UI

- **Post-crawl Summary** dashboard auto-opens with severity counts, top issues, and crawl stats.
- **Severity sidebar** - All Pages / Errors / Warnings / Info, each with live counts.
- **Issue grouping** - click any severity and see issues grouped by type with the worst-affected pages listed under each.
- **Page detail dock** - click any URL for full page metadata, all issues for that page, inlinks (with anchor text), outlinks.
- **Dark mode** - toggle in the topbar, persists per user.
- **Saved crawls** - every crawl auto-saved, reopenable from the Load Saved modal.
- **Sitemap + XLSX export buttons** in the topbar - one click each.

## Quick install (manual)

Requires Python 3.10+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/puneetindersingh/open-seo-crawler.git
cd open-seo-crawler
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```

Open [http://localhost:5002/](http://localhost:5002/) in your browser.

## One-line install - auto-start + auto-update (Linux / macOS / Windows)

Each installer registers the crawler as a background service that starts on boot/login, plus a daily auto-updater that pulls the latest from this repo (with rollback on failure). Installs to `~/open-seo-crawler` (or `%USERPROFILE%\open-seo-crawler` on Windows). Browser auto-opens to `http://localhost:5002/` when done.

| Platform | Install command |
|---|---|
| **Linux Mint / Ubuntu / Debian** | See [Linux section](#one-line-install-on-linux-mint--ubuntu--debian) |
| **macOS** (Intel + Apple Silicon) | See [macOS section](#one-line-install-on-macos) |
| **Windows 10 / 11** | See [Windows section](#one-line-install-on-windows-10--11) |

### One-line install on Linux Mint / Ubuntu / Debian

Open a terminal and paste:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puneetindersingh/open-seo-crawler/master/install.sh -o install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

That's it. When it finishes your browser opens to `http://localhost:5002/`.

Optional dry-run preflight (checks Python, port, disk, internet; makes no changes):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puneetindersingh/open-seo-crawler/master/install.sh -o install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh --check
```

What the installer does:

- Verifies prerequisites (Python 3.10+, systemd, sudo, disk space, free port 5002, internet)
- Installs `python3 / python3-venv / git / curl` via `apt` if missing
- **Old Ubuntu/Mint support**: if the system ships Python < 3.10 (e.g. Mint 20.x = Python 3.8), the installer adds the deadsnakes PPA and tries `python3.13` → `3.12` → `3.11` → `3.10` until one installs. If none are available, falls back to **compiling Python 3.10.14 from source** automatically (~5-15 min).
- Clones the repo, creates a virtualenv, installs Python deps
- Registers `open-seo-crawler.service` so the crawler starts on every boot
- Registers `open-seo-crawler-update.timer` to `git pull` + restart 2 min after every boot and once daily (auto-rolls-back on any failure)
- Prints the access URLs (`http://localhost:5002/` plus your LAN IP) and auto-opens the browser if you're on a desktop
- Saves the URLs to `~/open-seo-crawler/ACCESS_URLS.txt` for later

Useful commands after install:

```bash
systemctl status open-seo-crawler                  # is it running?
sudo systemctl restart open-seo-crawler            # restart
sudo systemctl disable open-seo-crawler            # stop autostarting on boot
./install.sh --update-now                          # force a git-pull + restart now
systemctl list-timers | grep open-seo-crawler      # when's the next auto-update?
journalctl -u open-seo-crawler-update.service -n 50  # update history
sudo systemctl disable --now open-seo-crawler-update.timer  # turn auto-update off
tail -f /var/log/open-seo-crawler.log              # live app logs
```

### One-line install on macOS

Works on Intel + Apple Silicon, macOS 11 Big Sur and newer. Uses Homebrew + `launchd`.

Open Terminal (⌘+Space → "Terminal") and paste:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puneetindersingh/open-seo-crawler/master/install-macos.sh -o install-macos.sh && chmod +x install-macos.sh && ./install-macos.sh
```

Dry-run preflight:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puneetindersingh/open-seo-crawler/master/install-macos.sh -o install-macos.sh && chmod +x install-macos.sh && ./install-macos.sh --check
```

What the installer does:

- Verifies prerequisites (macOS, Python 3.10+, disk space, free port 5002, internet)
- Installs Homebrew if missing (will prompt for your password)
- Installs `python@3.12` + `git` via Homebrew if missing
- Clones the repo, creates a virtualenv, installs Python deps
- Registers `io.openseocrawler.app` LaunchAgent (starts on login, restarts on crash)
- Registers `io.openseocrawler.update` LaunchAgent (runs 2 min after login + daily at 03:30 with auto-rollback)
- Opens `http://localhost:5002/` in your default browser

Useful commands after install:

```bash
launchctl list | grep openseocrawler                                                # is it running?
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/io.openseocrawler.app                           # restart
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/io.openseocrawler.app                                # stop
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.openseocrawler.app.plist                               # disable autostart
./install-macos.sh --update-now                                                     # force update now
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/OpenSEOCrawler/app.log                                       # live app logs
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/OpenSEOCrawler/update.log                                    # update history
```

### One-line install on Windows 10 / 11

Uses `winget` + a Startup-folder shortcut. No admin rights needed.

Open PowerShell (Start menu → type "powershell" → Enter) and paste:

```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puneetindersingh/open-seo-crawler/master/install-windows.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
```

Dry-run preflight:

```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puneetindersingh/open-seo-crawler/master/install-windows.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1 -Check
```

> The `Tls12` prefix forces a modern TLS handshake - without it, Windows PowerShell 5.1 on some machines defaults to TLS 1.0/1.1 and the GitHub download fails with *"Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel."*

What the installer does:

- Verifies prerequisites (Windows, Python 3.10+, disk space, free port 5002, internet)
- Installs Python 3.12 + Git via `winget` (pinned to `--source winget` so it never trips over the msstore source's certificate error) if missing
- Resolves the real `python.exe` directly (registry + standard install dirs), so the Microsoft Store `python` alias stub can't shadow a freshly-installed Python
- Clones the repo to `%USERPROFILE%\open-seo-crawler`, creates a virtualenv, installs Python deps
- Writes helper scripts (`Run.ps1`, `Stop.ps1`, `Update.ps1`, `Autostart.ps1`) into the install folder
- Adds Start Menu + Desktop shortcuts, and (unless `-NoAutostart`) a Startup-folder shortcut that pulls the latest code on each logon then launches the app in the background via `pythonw.exe` (no console window)
- Starts the crawler and opens `http://localhost:5002/` in your default browser

Flags: `-Check` (preflight only), `-UpdateNow` (pull + reinstall deps), `-NoAutostart` (skip the logon Startup shortcut).

Useful commands after install (PowerShell):

```powershell
& "$env:USERPROFILE\open-seo-crawler\Run.ps1"        # run in this window
& "$env:USERPROFILE\open-seo-crawler\Stop.ps1"       # stop whatever is on port 5002
& "$env:USERPROFILE\open-seo-crawler\Update.ps1"     # pull latest + reinstall deps if changed
Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\open-seo-crawler\autostart.log" -Tail 50 -Wait   # tail autostart/update log
```

To disable auto-start on logon, delete the `Open SEO Crawler (Autostart)` shortcut from
`%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`.

> If PowerShell's execution policy blocks the script, the `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` prefix shown above handles it. No admin rights are needed; `winget --scope user` and the user-level Startup shortcut both work without UAC.

### JS rendering (for SPAs and no-code builders)

Needed for React / Vue / Wix / Bubble / heavy Squarespace sites. Tick **Render JS** before a crawl: the first time, the crawler installs Playwright and Chromium into its own Python by itself (one-time download, a couple of minutes, progress shown in the corner). Sites whose menus are clickable elements with no `<a href>` links (Bubble and similar) are followed by clicking them in the headless browser, and each such page is flagged "JS-only navigation", because search engines only follow real links.

If the automatic setup fails (no internet, locked-down Python), the crawl tells you why. Install manually with the crawler's Python, then restart it:

```bash
python -m pip install playwright
python -m playwright install chromium
```

## Usage

1. Enter a website URL
2. (Optional) tweak defaults - 1500 pages, 5 workers, 0.4 s per-host delay, depth 10. **Sitemap analysis** and **Near-duplicate content (≥90% similarity)** are pre-checked so a fresh crawl runs both post-analyses automatically.
3. Click **Start crawl**

The tool detects the target's CMS on the first request and offers a one-click **Apply recommendations** button that populates sensible exclude patterns and worker counts.

The **Summary** tab auto-opens during the crawl and live-refreshes as pages come in. When the crawl finishes you have:

- A severity breakdown (Errors / Warnings / Info) with live counts
- Bulk reports for every common SEO audit (All Titles, Duplicate Titles, Redirect Chains, etc.)
- A page-detail dock for any URL (click a row): metadata, issues, inlinks, outlinks
- Sitemap + XLSX export buttons in the topbar

## Use cases

- **Pre-launch audit**: crawl a staging site, fix every Error before the redirect cutover.
- **Post-launch verification**: re-crawl after a migration and compare Redirect Chains, Response Codes, and Hreflang reports against the pre-migration crawl.
- **Periodic technical SEO health-checks**: weekly crawl of your main domain to catch regressions in canonicals, duplicate titles, broken internal links.
- **Competitor research**: crawl a competitor's site (responsibly, respecting their robots.txt) to understand their internal linking, content depth, and structured data coverage.
- **Bulk meta audits**: export All Titles or All Metas, hand the XLSX to a content team for rewrites.
- **Hreflang debugging**: international sites with regional subfolders or subdomains can validate every hreflang annotation in one click.
- **Sitemap hygiene**: catch sitemap-only URLs (in sitemap, not actually linked from the site), orphans (linked but not in sitemap), and stale URLs that return 404 / 301.

## Settings reference

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Max pages | 1500 | Cap on total URLs crawled (1-5000 + Unlimited) |
| Workers | 5 | Concurrent HTTP workers (1-20) |
| Per-host delay | 0.4 s | Min gap between two requests to the same host. A warning is shown if set below 0.4 s |
| Max depth | 10 | Clicks from seed URL |
| Render JS | off | Enable for SPAs (requires Playwright) |
| Compare with non-JS HTML | off | With Render JS on: crawl each page in both modes, diff flags JS-only content invisible to non-JS crawlers |
| Ignore robots.txt | off | Default: respect Disallow rules |
| Ignore noindex | off | Default: noindex pages excluded from duplicate / orphan reports |
| Sitemap analysis | **on** | Post-crawl: flags missing from sitemap, orphans, sitemap-only, non-200, redirects in sitemap |
| Near-duplicate content | **on** at 90% | Shingle Jaccard on body content; flag pairs ≥ 90% similar (tweak to 80 / 85 / 90 or custom) |
| Include / exclude patterns | empty | Glob wildcards, e.g. `*?variant=*`, `*/cart/*` |

Optional environment variables (for shared / multi-tool setups):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SITE_CRAWLER_EXTRA_CRAWL_DIRS` | Colon-separated extra folders to union (read-only) into the saved-crawls list, so one instance shows crawls saved by other tools |
| `SITE_CRAWLER_USER_MAP` | Path to a JSON dict mapping IP → friendly name (default `~/.site-crawler-users.json`), so saved crawls show who ran them instead of an IP |

## Performance

Tested on a Shopify store:

- **10 pages in 3.3 seconds** (5 workers, 0.1 s delay)
- **~3× faster** than a single-threaded crawler with 1 s delay
- **1500-page WordPress site** crawled in under 3 minutes (5 workers, default delay)

Concurrency scales linearly up to about 8 workers before target server rate limits become the bottleneck.

## Privacy

Runs entirely on your machine. No API calls, no accounts, no telemetry. The only HTTP requests made are to the target site you're crawling and (when you click "check for updates") `api.github.com` to read the latest commit SHA on this repo.

## Responsible use

You are responsible for the targets you crawl. Before pointing this tool at a site you don't own:

- **Respect `robots.txt`.** It's on by default for a reason. Disabling it on a site you don't own may violate that site's terms of service.
- **Respect rate limits.** The default `0.4 s` per-host delay and 5-worker concurrency are conservative. Keep them, or raise them, when crawling production sites. Hammering a server can be treated as abuse.
- **Honour the target's terms of service.** Some sites explicitly prohibit automated crawling. Read their ToS before scanning.
- **Personal / private data.** If a crawled page contains personal data, applicable privacy law (GDPR / UK GDPR / Australian Privacy Act / CCPA, etc.) may apply to anything you do with it afterwards. This tool stores results only in your local browser / process; what you do next is your responsibility.

The authors accept no liability for misuse. See the LICENSE for the full disclaimer.

## FAQ

**Is there a free SEO crawler?**
Yes. Open SEO Crawler is a free, MIT-licensed SEO crawler with no page limit. Clone it, run `python3 app.py`, and crawl any website locally - no account, no API key, no credit card.

**What is the best free Screaming Frog alternative?**
Open SEO Crawler covers the core technical-SEO crawl most people use Screaming Frog for - titles, meta descriptions, H1s, canonicals, redirects, broken links, hreflang, duplicate content, sitemaps, and structured data - with unlimited URLs in the free tier and one-click XLSX export. The free Screaming Frog tier caps at 500 URLs; this has no cap.

**Can this SEO crawler handle large websites?**
Yes. It crawls concurrently (1-20 workers) with per-host rate limiting. A 1,500-page site finishes in under three minutes on default settings; set the page cap to Unlimited for bigger sites.

**Does the website crawler work on Shopify, WordPress, and Webflow?**
Yes. It auto-detects 10 CMS platforms (Shopify, WordPress + Yoast / Rank Math, Webflow, Wix, Squarespace, Kajabi, Ghost, Drupal, HubSpot, Joomla) and applies sensible crawl presets for each.

**Is it really free and open source?**
Yes - MIT licensed and self-hosted, running entirely on your machine. No telemetry, no phone-home, no per-URL billing.
